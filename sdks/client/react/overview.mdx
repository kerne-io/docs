The React SDK (published as `@kerne/react`) is the easiest way to integrate Kerne into your frontend application. It provides a set of hooks and a context provider to manage authentication and monetization seamlessly.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @kerne/react
```

## Initialization

Wrap your application with the `KerneProvider` at the root Level.

```tsx
import { KerneProvider } from '@kerne/react';

function Root() {
  return (
    <KerneProvider appId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_KERNE_APP_ID}>
      <App />
    </KerneProvider>
  );
}
```

## Core hooks

The React SDK provides hooks to interact with various Kerne modules:

- **`useAuth()`**: Access the [current user](/sdks/client/react/auth/session) and handle [authentication flows](/sdks/client/react/auth/login).
- **`useBilling()`**: [Check entitlements](/sdks/client/react/billing/consumption/check-entitlement) and [create checkout sessions](/sdks/client/react/billing/checkout/checkout).
- **`useClient()`**: Access the underlying low-level client for custom operations.

## Example: Protecting a feature

You can use the `useBilling` hook to gate features based on a user's subscription.

```tsx
import { useBilling } from '@kerne/react';

function AdvancedExport() {
  const { checkEntitlement } = useBilling();
  const [hasAccess, setHasAccess] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    checkEntitlement('advanced_export').then(setHasAccess);
  }, []);

  if (!hasAccess) {
    return <p>Upgrade your plan to use this feature.</p>;
  }

  return <button>Export Data</button>;
}
```

## Error handling

Our hooks handle common errors automatically. For custom error handling, catch exceptions from the returned methods. See the [error codes](/concepts/error-codes) page for more details.
