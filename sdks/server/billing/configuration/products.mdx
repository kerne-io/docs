The `products` module allows you to define the high-level offerings of your application. These are synchronized with Stripe to handle billing.

For more information on how products relate to plans, see the [Products and plans](/concepts/monetization/products-and-plans) concept page.

## List products

Retrieves all products defined for your application.

### Signature
```typescript
kerne.billing.products.list(): Promise<Product[]>
```

## Create product

Creates a new product in Kerne and automatically synchronizes it with your connected Stripe account.

### Signature
```typescript
kerne.billing.products.create(params: CreateProductParams): Promise<Product>
```

## Update product

Updates the metadata of an existing product.

### Signature
```typescript
kerne.billing.products.update(id: string, params: UpdateProductParams): Promise<Product>
```

## Delete product

Permanently removes a product. This will also archive the corresponding product in Stripe.

### Signature
```typescript

```
