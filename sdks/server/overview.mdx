## Core modules

Our server SDKs are organized into logical modules:

- **Users**: Manage user profiles, roles, and status.
- **Waitlist**: Handle waitlist entries and growth.
- **Invitations**: Manage application invitations.
- **Billing**: Configure products/plans and report usage.
- **Webhooks**: Securely verify and process events from Kerne.
