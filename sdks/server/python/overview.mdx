The Python SDK will provide a seamless way to interact with Kerne from your Python applications (Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.).

## Installation

```bash
pip install kerne-sdk
```

## Initialization

```python
from kerne import Kerne

kerne = Kerne(
    secret_key="sk_live_...",
    base_url="https://api.kerne.io"
)
```
