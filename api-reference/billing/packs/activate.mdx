title: "Activate pack"
api: "POST /v1/packs/:id/activate"
---

Activate a pack, making it the current version for new subscriptions.

## Authentication

<Note>
This endpoint requires **secret key** authentication (`sk_live_...`).
</Note>

## Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Pack ID to activate. |

## Response

```json
{
  "id": "pack_01234567890abcdef",
  "plan_id": "plan_pro_monthly",
  "version": 3,
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "created_at": "2025-01-20T00:00:00.000Z",
  "entitlements": [...]
}
```

## Behavior

- The pack's status changes from `DRAFT` to `ACTIVE`
- The previously active pack is set to `ARCHIVED`
- **Existing subscriptions keep their original pack** (grandfathering)
- Only new subscriptions get the newly active pack

<Important>
This enables grandfathering: users who subscribed to an older version of the plan keep their original entitlements, even if the plan changes.
