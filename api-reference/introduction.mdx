The Kerne API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base url

All API requests should be made to:

```http
https://<your-app-slug>.api.kerne.io/v1
```

## Authentication

Authenticate your requests by including your secret key in the `Authorization` header.

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_...
```

<Note>
Find your API keys in the Kerne Dashboard under **Settings > api keys**.

## Response format

All responses are returned in JSON format.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

In case of an error, the response will include a standardized error code and a message. For a full list of possible error codes, see the [error codes](/concepts/error-codes) page.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "K1005",
    "message": "Invalid credentials"
  }
}
```
