Kerne aligns its data model with Stripe to ensure a seamless sync between your application code and your billing provider.

## The hierarchy

Understanding how Kerne maps to Stripe is key to designing your pricing model.

### 1. Product (The "Container")
A **Product** in Kerne represents your application or service line.
- Most SaaS apps have a single product.
- **Maps to**: Conceptually a "Product Family" (internal to Kerne).

### 2. Plan (The "Tier")
A **Plan** represents a specific level of service (e.g., "Free", "Pro", "Enterprise").
- **Maps to**: **Stripe Product**.
- Each Plan contains specific [entitlements](/concepts/monetization/entitlements) (features).

### 3. Price (The "Billing Option")
A **Price** is a specific billing configuration for a Plan (e.g., "$29/month", "$290/year").
- **Maps to**: **Stripe Price**.
- You can have multiple prices for the same plan (monthly, yearly, regional).

<Info>
**Why this matters**: In Stripe, a "Product" is what you see on the invoice line item (e.g., "Pro Plan"). Kerne matches this mental model so you don't get confused when looking at your Stripe dashboard.
