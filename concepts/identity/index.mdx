Identity in Kerne follows the principle of **separation of concerns**. We distinguish between who a user is, what they can do, and what they have paid for.

## Authentication

**Question**: "Who are you?"

Authentication verifies a user's identity. Kerne supports several modern flows out of the box:
- **Email and password**: Secure credential-based login.
- **Magic links**: Passwordless authentication via secure email tokens.
- **Social OAuth**: Seamless integration with providers like Google and GitHub.

## Authorization

**Question**: "What can you do?"

Authorization defines the permissions a user holds within a specific environment.
- **Roles**: Groups of permissions (e.g., `Admin`, `Member`).
- **Permissions**: Specific actions allowed (e.g., `manage_billing`, `delete_projects`).

<Info>
We are currently expanding the authorization system to support nested organizations and granular relationship-based access control.

## Entitlements

**Question**: "What have you paid for?"

Entitlements are specific authorizations tied to a subscription. They allow you to gate features based on a customer's current plan.

<Tip>
Think of entitlements as "monetized permissions." A user might be an `Admin` for their team, but if the team is on a `Starter` plan, they won't have the `advanced_analytics` entitlement.
