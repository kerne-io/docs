<Note>
**Coming soon**
We are currently working on a robust Authorization (AuthZ) system including Organizations and granular RBAC.
</Note>

Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do within your application.

## Core concepts

### Roles
A role is a collection of permissions. Common roles include `Admin`, `Editor`, and `Viewer`.

### Permissions
Permissions are granular actions that can be performed on resources (e.g., `create:project`, `delete:user`).

### Organizations
Organizations (or Teams) allow you to group users together. A user can belong to multiple organizations and have different roles in each.

## Current state

For now, Kerne provides basic role-based access control at the application level. You can assign a role to a user during registration or via the Admin API.

```typescript
// Assignment example (Server SDK)
await kerne.users.update('usr_123', {
  role: 'ADMIN'
});
```
