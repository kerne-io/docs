Kerne allows you to control how new users join your application. You can switch between these modes in the dashboard without changing your code.

## 1. Open registration
The standard flow for public applications. Anyone can sign up and immediately access the application.
*   **Best for**: B2C apps, self-serve SaaS.
*   **Implementation**: Use the [register](/sdks/client/nextjs/auth/register) method in your frontend.

## 2. Waitlist mode
Users can sign up, but they are placed in a "Pending" state. They cannot log in until an administrator approves their request.
*   **Best for**: Private betas, capacity management, manual vetting.
*   **Implementation**: Users sign up via [register](/sdks/client/nextjs/auth/register). Admins manage entries using the [Waitlist](/sdks/server/growth/waitlist) module in the Server SDK.

## 3. Invitation only
Public registration is completely disabled. New users can only be created if:
1.  **Admin invite**: An administrator sends an email invitation.
2.  **Invite code**: The user provides a valid, multi-use invitation code (e.g., `EARLY_ACCESS_2025`).

*   **Best for**: Enterprise SaaS, exclusive communities, internal tools.
*   **Implementation**: Admins generate codes/tokens using the [Invitations](/sdks/server/growth/invitations) module. Users sign up by providing the code to the [register](/sdks/client/nextjs/auth/register) method.
