Kerne is a developer-first platform designed to handle the critical infrastructure of modern SaaS applications: **Authentication** and **Monetization**.

## The philosophy

We believe that developers should spend their time building their core product, not reinventing the wheel for user sessions or Stripe integrations.

Kerne provides a unified API and SDK layer that sits between your application and your customers, ensuring security, scalability, and a premium user experience from day one.

## Core pillars

### 1. Secure identity
A security-first approach to authentication. We handle the complexity of session management and identity verification so you can trust who is logged in.

### 2. Native monetization
Decouple your code from your pricing. Define features and entitlements in the dashboard, and check them in your code with a single line. No more hardcoded plan checks.

### 3. Developer experience
Clean APIs, type-safe SDKs, and comprehensive documentation. We build the tools we want to use.
