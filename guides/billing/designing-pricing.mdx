title: "Designing your pricing"
description: "From simple subscriptions to usage-based models"
---

A well-designed pricing model is scalable, easy to understand, and maps directly to your code. Kerne allows you to iterate on pricing without rewriting your application logic.

## The core concepts

1.  **Entitlements (Features)**: What the user *gets* (e.g., "Can export PDF").
2.  **Plans (Tiers)**: A bundle of entitlements (e.g., "Pro Plan").
3.  **Prices (Billing)**: How much they pay for the plan (e.g., "$29/mo").

<Tip>
**Golden Rule**: Your code should check **Entitlements**, never Plans.
*   **Bad**: `if (user.plan === 'pro')`
*   **Good**: `if (checkEntitlement('can_export_pdf'))`
</Tip>

## Model 1: The "Good-Better-Best" (Flat Rate)

This is the standard SaaS model.
- **Free**: Limited features.
- **Pro**: All features.

**Implementation**:
1.  Create features: `can_access_dashboard`, `can_invite_members`.
2.  Create plans:
    - **Free Plan**: Includes `can_access_dashboard`.
    - **Pro Plan**: Includes `can_access_dashboard` + `can_invite_members`.

## Model 2: The "Pay-as-you-go" (Usage Based)

Charge based on consumption (e.g., API calls, emails sent).

**Implementation**:
1.  Create a feature `emails_sent` with type **Quota**.
2.  Set the **Reset Policy**:
    - `RESET`: Counter resets every month (e.g., "1000 emails/mo included").
    - `ACCUMULATE`: Credits roll over (e.g., "Pre-paid email credits").
3.  Report usage via the SDK:
    ```typescript
    await kerne.billing.reportUsage('emails_sent', 1);
    ```

## Model 3: The Hybrid (Seat-based + Usage)

$20/seat/month + $0.01/email.

**Implementation**:
1.  Configure the Product as "Per Unit" (Seat based).
2.  Add a generic "Usage" entitlement for emails.
