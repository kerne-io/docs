Choosing an authentication model is one of the first and most critical decisions you will make. It is difficult to change later.

## Recommendation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Building B2B SaaS?" icon="building">
    Start with **invitation only** or **waitlist**. It ensures teams are grouped correctly and creates exclusivity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Building B2C Consumer?" icon="users">
    Use **open registration** and **social login**. Friction is your primary enemy; prioritize one-click access.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The decision matrix

| Feature | B2C (Consumer) | B2B (SaaS) |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Sign up** | Open to everyone | Often restricted (invite/waitlist) |
| **Identity** | Individual (user) | Collective (application/team) |
| **Billing** | Per user | Per application/seat |
| **Security** | Low friction | High security (mfa, sso) |

## The trap of open registration

Most developers default to **open registration** (anyone can sign up), but for B2B, this is often a mistake.

### Why open registration hurts B2B
1.  **Spam and bot signups**: You will likely be flooded by qualified leads mixed with bots.
2.  **Support load**: Non-qualified users increase your support overhead without contributing revenue.
3.  **Application confusion**: If User A creates "Application A" and their colleague User B creates "Application B", they cannot collaborate or see shared data.

## Implementation path

Start by setting your registration mode in the dashboard or via the SDK.

```typescript
// Example: Setting registration to INVITE_ONLY
await kerne.settings.update({
  registrationMode: 'INVITE_ONLY'
});
```

<Tip>
Even if you plan to go open eventually, starting with a restricted model allows you to learn from your first few users through high-touch onboarding.
