Building an invite-only application is a great way to control growth and validate your product with high-quality users.

## Architecture

To build an invite-only flow, you need three components:
1.  **Restricted registration**: Disabling public signups at the API level.
2.  **Code generation**: Creating unique, signed codes for your users.
3.  **Signup validation**: Checking the code on the frontend before account creation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your application">
    In the Kerne Dashboard, navigate to **Settings > registration** and select **Invitation only**.
    This enforces the check at the API level. Even if someone attempts to bypass your frontend, they cannot sign up without a valid code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create codes (server-side)">
    Use the server SDK to generate unique codes. You can create one-time codes or reusable ones for marketing campaigns.

    ```typescript
    import { Kerne } from '@kerne/server';

    const kerne = new Kerne({ ... });

    // Create a reusable code for a launch event
    await kerne.invitations.createCode({
      code: 'PRIVATE_BETA_2025',
      maxUsages: 100,
      expiresAt: '2025-12-31'
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement the signup flow (client-side)">
    Your signup form needs an extra field for the `invitationCode`.

    ```tsx
    import { useAuth } from '@kerne/react';

    function SignupForm() {
      const { register } = useAuth();

      const handleSignup = async (data) => {
        try {
          await register({
            email: data.email,
            password: data.password,
            invitationCode: data.code // The secret key to entry
          });
        } catch (err) {
          if (err.code === 'K1001') {
            setError('This code is invalid or has expired.');
          }
        }
      };
      // ... render form
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pitfalls to avoid

### The "account already exists" trap
If a user tries to sign up with an invite code but already has an account, provide a clear path forward.
- **Bad**: "Registration failed."
- **Good**: "You already have an account! Please log in to join this organization."

### Handling lost invites
Users frequently lose invitation tokens.
- **Solution**: Implement a "Resend invitation" flow using `kerne.invitations.resend()` on your server to verify the email and send a new link.
